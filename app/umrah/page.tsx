    "Umrah packages from Pakistan, quoted on inquiry for your exact dates. Economy, premium, and Ramadan Umrah with hotels near the Haram, visa, flights, and Ziyarat.",
  alternates: { canonical: "/umrah" },
  openGraph: { url: "/umrah" },
};

const hubFaqs = [
  {
    q: "How does pricing work for Umrah packages?",
    a: "Umrah pricing is quoted on inquiry because airfare and hotel rates update every week. Our team checks live fares for your exact travel dates and sends the current best price on WhatsApp, with no hidden charges and no stale published numbers. Message our desk with your dates and group size for a same day quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is included in an Umrah package?",
    a: "Each Umrah package covers the Saudi e-visa through Nusuk, return flights, hotels near the Haram, ground transport between Makkah and Madinah, and guided Ziyarat at both holy sites. Our desk confirms every inclusion in writing before you pay, so nothing on the journey surprises you.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which cities do Umrah flights depart from?",
    a: "Umrah flights depart from Peshawar and Islamabad, whichever carries the better fare and schedule for your dates. Our team arranges onward ground transport, and travelers from nearby towns coordinate airport pickup with our desk when they book.",
  },
  {
    q: "What room sharing options are available for Umrah?",
    a: "Room sharing for Umrah follows your group size and budget, and our team arranges the layout that fits, from quad to triple to double. Tell our desk how many travelers share a room, and we quote hotels near the Haram to match. Exact sharing and hotel names are confirmed for your dates before you pay.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do the economy, premium, and five star tiers differ?",
    a: "Economy suits budget conscious pilgrims, with shared rooms and hotels within walking or shuttle distance of the Haram. Premium and five star place you in hotels near or facing the Haram, with fewer travelers per room and private transport. Compare the tiers side by side above, then message our desk for a quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "How early should I book, especially for Ramadan Umrah?",
    a: "Book as early as your dates allow, since hotels near the Haram and airline seats fill months ahead. Ramadan Umrah fills first, and the last Ashra sells out earliest, so plan well before Ramadan 2027. For a regular Umrah, three to six weeks gives comfortable time for visa processing and the best fares.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build custom Umrah packages for my group?",
    a: "Yes. Our team builds custom Umrah packages for families, offices, and community groups of any size. Share your travel dates, group size, and the tier you want, and our desk designs the arrangements, prepares documents, and sends one quote for the whole group.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you adjust the hotels, dates, or duration within a package?",
    a: "Yes. Every Umrah package flexes around your dates, budget, and group. Our desk adjusts the hotel tier, the room sharing, the duration, and the departure city, then quotes the current best price for the version you choose. Tell us what matters most, and we build the package around it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get a quote and book an Umrah?",
    a: "Booking starts with one WhatsApp message or a visit to the Charsadda office. Our team sends options and a quote for your exact dates the same day. Once you choose, a deposit secures your seats and rooms, the balance settles before departure, and every amount stays confirmed in writing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you also arrange Hajj?",
    a: "Yes. Hajj sits in its own program with government scheme registration through MORA, Maktab camps at Mina and Arafat, trained group leaders, and pre-departure training. See the Hajj package for the full flow, or ask our desk to plan your Hajj alongside your Umrah.",
  },
  {
    q: "How close are your Umrah hotels to the Haram?",
    a: "Economy Umrah books hotels within walking or shuttle distance of the Haram, while premium and five star tiers sit near or facing it, steps from the gates. Exact hotel names and distances are confirmed for your travel dates before you pay, since the closest rooms fill early through the year.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Makkah and Madinah night split on an Umrah?",
    a: "Your nights split across Makkah and Madinah to suit your priorities, whether more days at Masjid al-Haram for worship or a longer stay in Madinah for the Rawdah and Ziyarat. The exact split is set for your dates and duration, and our desk confirms it with your quote.",
