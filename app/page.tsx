              Umrah is the minor pilgrimage, performed year round. Pilgrims enter
              in Ihram, perform Tawaf around the Kaaba, and complete Sa'i between
              Safa and Marwah, then release Ihram with Halq or Taqsir. Hajj is the
              obligatory pilgrimage of Dhul Hijjah, performed once by those who
              are able. Hajj keeps the Umrah rites and adds the standing at
              Arafat, the night at Muzdalifah, and the days at Mina, registered
              through MORA in Pakistan and Nusuk in Saudi Arabia. The plain
              difference: Umrah is shorter, year round, and voluntary, while Hajj
              falls in Dhul Hijjah, adds Arafat, Muzdalifah, and Mina, and is
              obligatory once for those who are able.

            Every Umrah package covers the Saudi e-visa, flights, hotels,
            transport, and guided Ziyarat, so the choice comes down to comfort
            and budget. Economy suits budget conscious pilgrims, with shared
            rooms and hotels within walking or shuttle distance of the Haram.
            Premium and five star place you in hotels near or facing the Haram,
            with fewer travelers per room and private transport. Ramadan
            programs focus on the last Ashra and the nights of Laylat al-Qadr,
            and book months ahead. Family and group options run across every
            tier, with connected rooms arranged. Durations run from 7 to 30 days,
            departing from Peshawar and Islamabad.
