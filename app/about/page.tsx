            {site.name} was founded in Charsadda as the sister company of{" "}
            {site.sisterCompany}, carrying forward years of experience in
            serving pilgrims and travelers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and

            The name Al Raqeem comes from the Quran, from Surah Al Kahf, where
            it is mentioned alongside the People of the Cave. It reminds us
            that every journey is recorded and every trust must be honored. We
            chose it deliberately: in an industry where promises are cheap, our
            name itself is a commitment to accountability.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            From our head office in Charsadda, we serve clients across
            Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Tangi, Shabqadar and all
            of Pakistan. Most of our work arrives the same way it always has:
            one family travels with us, and then their relatives, neighbors and
            friends follow. That only happens when people are treated right.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
            Whether it is a parent's first Umrah, a honeymoon in Turkey, or a
            family holiday in Dubai, our approach never changes: clear pricing,
            complete arrangements, and support that lasts until you are home
            safely.
