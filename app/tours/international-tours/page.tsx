const faqs = [
  {
    q: "How much is an international tour package from Pakistan?",
    a: "International tours are quoted on inquiry, since airfare and hotel rates move every week. Our desk reads the live fares for your exact dates and destination and sends the current best price on WhatsApp, with no hidden charges and no stale published number. Message us with your dates and group size for a same day quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which are the best international destinations from Pakistan?",
    a: "Our most booked routes are Dubai, Turkey, Baku, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, plus the Malaysia with Thailand combo and the three country grand tour. Dubai and Turkey lead for first trips, Malaysia and Baku for a halal friendly family trip, and Thailand and Singapore for beaches and theme parks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do international tour packages include the visa and flights?",
    a: "Yes. Every international package includes the visit visa and return flights, prepared and booked by our team, along with the hotels and guided sightseeing in one booking. Our desk checks every document before filing, so the visa clears without avoidable delays.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which cities do you fly international tours from?",
    a: "Our desk departs travelers from Peshawar and Islamabad for most routes, and from Karachi or Lahore where the fare and schedule suit your dates. Travelers near our Charsadda base fly from Peshawar or Islamabad, with airport pickup coordinated when you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are international tours halal and Muslim friendly?",
    a: "Yes. Malaysia, Turkey, Baku, and Dubai sit in Muslim countries where halal food is everywhere and prayer is easy, and our desk arranges halal meals and prayer stops on every route, including Thailand and Singapore. See our Muslim friendly tours for the halal focused list.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer luxury or five star international tours?",
    a: "Yes. Our desk arranges five star hotels, private transport, and business class flights on any international route, from a facing the beach stay in Thailand to a central Marina hotel in Dubai. Tell us the comfort level you want, and we quote the upgraded trip for your dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are international tours good for families and honeymooners?",
    a: "Yes. Our tours suit families and honeymooners alike, with comfortable hotels, guided sightseeing, and a pace our team adjusts for children and couples. See our family tours and honeymoon tours for the curated lists, and tell our desk your group and any needs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the best time to travel on an international tour?",
    a: "The best window depends on the destination, from the cooler winter months in Dubai to spring and autumn in Turkey and November to February for the Far East beaches. Our desk builds the trip around comfortable weather, sensible crowds, and your budget. Tell us your preferred dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you customize international tours or combine two countries?",
    a: "Yes. Our desk shapes each tour around your dates, hotel choice, and excursions, and combines destinations like Malaysia with Thailand, or all three with Singapore, in one booking. Tell us your plan, and we quote the customized or combined route for your group.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are these group departures or private trips?",
    a: "Both. Join a group departure for the friendliest price and a set itinerary, or ask our desk for a private tour with your own vehicle, guide, and pace. Tell us your group size and how you prefer to travel, and we quote the option that fits your dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What drives the cost of an international tour?",
    a: "The airline and departure city, the travel season, the hotel star rating, and the group size set each quote, along with any optional excursions. Our desk reads them live for your dates and sends the current best price, with no hidden charges and no stale published number.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I book and get a quote for an international tour?",
    a: "Message our desk on WhatsApp with your destination, dates, and group size, or visit our Charsadda office. We send options and a quote for your exact dates the same day, a deposit secures your seats and rooms, and the balance settles before departure, every amount confirmed in writing.",

              Al Raqeem arranges international tours for travelers who want the
              visa, flights, hotels, and sightseeing in one booking rather than a
              trip stitched together from a dozen websites. Our desk in Charsadda
              books Dubai with the Burj Khalifa and a desert safari, Turkey across
              Istanbul and Cappadocia, Baku on the Caspian, and the Far East from
              Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok and Singapore, and stays with you on
              WhatsApp from the first inquiry to your safe return.
            </p>
            <p>
              Departures run from Peshawar and Islamabad for most routes, and from
              Karachi or Lahore where the fare and schedule suit your dates.
              Travelers near our Charsadda base start closest of all, and our team
              coordinates the airport pickup and the onward transfers so the
              journey holds together from your doorstep.

              and sends the current best price, with no hidden charges and no
              stale published number. Rates update weekly with airfare and hotel
