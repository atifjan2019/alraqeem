    q: "How does pricing work for tour packages?",

  },
  {
    q: "Do tour packages include the visa and flights?",

    q: "Do you build custom group tours?",
    a: "Yes. Our team builds custom tours for families, offices, and community groups of any size, to any destination we serve. Share your dates, group size, and the experience you want, and our desk designs the itinerary, arranges documents, and sends one quote for the whole group.",
