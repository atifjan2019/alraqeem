## Edit your content (no coding needed)

All content lives in 4 files inside `lib/`:

| File | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `lib/site.ts` | Phone, WhatsApp, email, address, domain. EDIT THIS FIRST. |
| `lib/packages.ts` | All 12 packages, prices, highlights. Set `price: null` for "Contact for price". |
| `lib/cities.ts` | The 7 city landing pages. Copy a block to add a new city. |
| `lib/posts.ts` | Blog articles. Copy a block to add a new post. |

## Placeholders to replace before launch

1. `lib/site.ts`: phone `+92 300 0000000`, WhatsApp `923000000000`, email, exact office address
2. `lib/site.ts`: `url` once you buy your domain
3. `lib/packages.ts`: confirm real prices
