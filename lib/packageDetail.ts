        a: "Economy Umrah flights depart from Bacha Khan International in Peshawar or Islamabad International, whichever carries the better fare and schedule for your dates.

      },
      {
        q: "Are meals included in the Economy Umrah Package?",
        a: "Economy packages are usually room only or with breakfast, since keeping meals flexible holds the cost down near the Haram, where affordable food sits close by.
